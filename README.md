# BURN THE CONTRIBUTOR COVENANT WITH FIRE!

## This is not an incitement to violence and\/or property damage
This should go without saying, but we live in unhinged and delusional times\. \"Burn the Contributor Covenant with Fire\" is not in any way an incitement toward violence or property damage\. The item in question is digital\. It is merely a metaphor expressing intense disapproval of the Contributor Covenant and unwillingness to use it on my own projects\.

## Purpose
This is primarily intended for inclusion in my own projects in place of a CODE_OF_CONDUCT\.md file\. You are free to use or modify it as you wish for your own projects\.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute revisions, grammatical corrections, Markdown formatting fixes, etc\. Please open an issue or pull request\. I **will not** be bullied into taking this down or removing it from my projects\. The spirit of this project and document will not change\.

## Criticism of the Contributor Covenant is not a violation of the Contributor Covenant
I am willing to contribute to projects that adopt the Contributor Covenant\. Criticism of or invective against the Contributor Covenant is not harassment and is in no way a violation of the Code of Conduct of any site\.
